# Create 7x6 Grid
    How?
        Flex?
        Two loops, one to make the columns, one to make the rows (a bunch of div)
            data attributes? span?
        Make the boxes visible

# Pages can add discs
    How do we add discs?
    Two divs, one for each color. 
    We need a spot where we can clone each color
    When you click on the column the disc will drop
    The discs will be divs, will we be appending them like in Hanoi?

# Game checks for wins, vertically, horizontally and diagnally
    How?
    Winning condition when you have four discs of the same color in a row. 
    What happens when we win? innerText to print on the page
    Game lets user know if the game ends in a Red win, a Black win or a Tie
    How will we create a condition that makes a tie, what happens when there is a tie? - Simlar to the maze?
        Create a condtion that alerts when all of the pieces are on the board, but there are no pieces of the same color four in a row.

# CSS, how fancy are we going to get?
Basic
Borders
Background color
Lines for the grid
Grid color?




We are going to use the rules of the maze to set up the board and Hanoi to make it play
